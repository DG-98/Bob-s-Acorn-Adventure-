1. create basic html elements
2. Extremely basic css just to get an idea of working space
3. Reference present HTML elements in JS
4. get game context (2d)

5. Get variables for use.

6.Create function to create elements of the game
(undecided if there will be two creation functions for the character and items, or one for both with different behaviors)

7. Player and items can both be the same 'character' (think ogre and player) with different sizes.
   falling items will be 'killed' by the player since it seems like the easiest way to go about the interaction
8. bomb interaction will be the same but I'll have to find a way for them to be killed and the interaction to also take away from player hp.
