# SEI-project-1

The concept of the game is to to catch items (undetermined as of now) to increase your score. If you catch 'bombs' (also undetermined as of now) you lose health or lose a life. 



# Tech 
I will be building 'untitled game' with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I will also use HTML canvas to create the gameplay area and mechanics.

The game will be played along the X axis exclusively, limited by the edges of the screen.
A number of items will fall from the sky and your goal is to catch as many as you can but you have to keep an eye out for deadly bombs. 

# MVP Goals
- A moveable character that is movable along the X-axis and unable to move beyond the boundaries of the play area
- A number keeping track of the current player score
- A tracker for the current lives of the player
- The ability to catch items and increase your score
- The ability to be harmed by falling bombs.

# Stretch Goals 
- The ability to have health restored by more beneficial items
- Increasing speed as the game goes on 
- Fleshed out art and background 
- (Super stretch) The ability to jump and dodge moving projectiles moving along the X-axis
