# Bob's Acorn Adventure 

The concept of the game is to to catch Acorns because Bob needs to have food for the winter. You have to be careful and avoid one of the natural predators of a squirrel which are some really ugly eagles because they have to eat too. 



# Tech 
I will be building Bob's Acorn Adventure with HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I will also use HTML canvas to create the gameplay area and mechanics.

The game will be played along the X axis exclusively, limited by the edges of the screen.
A number of Acorns will fall from the sky and your goal is to catch as many as you can but you have to keep an eye out for deadly Eagles.
